# Binary Search Trees

## What is tree?
Binary Search Tree is a collection of elements that connects each other, and that looks like a upside-down ðŸŒ².

Each elements in trees are `node`, which is similar to the linked list. Node has two pieces of information; value and a pointer. The beginning node of the tree is called a `root node`.

The nodes that pints out from the root node are child nodes, and the root node is going to be a parent node. These child nodes can have their own child nodes... Yes, a node can be a parent node and a child node at the same time.
Chile node who don't have any children are called leaf node.

## Binary tree
Binary Tree is a type of tree that a node has at most two child nodes. Since a node can have two child node maximum, each children is called `left node` and `right node`.


## Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree, that left child is always less than a parent node and the right node is always greater than the parent.
